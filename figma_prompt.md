Version 1:


Redesign Flutter App to Match Figma Layout

Rebuild the existing Flutter app to precisely match the structure, layout, and styling defined in the Figma design, while preserving all current functionality aligned with the new UI.

Requirements:
- Use Figma as the single source of truth for layout, spacing, and UI components; update theme files for global consistency.
- Preserve all backend/business logic; map current view/tile logic to new Figma components.
- Integrate new widgets and elements with stub callbacks (onTap: () {}) for future features.
- Rebuild screens from scratch for clean, maintainable UI structure integrating smoothly with existing logic.
- Modify Supabase schemas if needed to support UI redesign.
- Focus solely on design replication and workflow alignment; no testing needed at this stage.

Notes:
- Pixel-perfect recreation of Figma design is the goal.
- Full control over codebase: refactor, rename, reorganize as needed.
- Project is version-controlled; changes are trackable and reversible.

Figma Design Files: [Provide links or references here]


Version 2:

Redesign the Flutter app screen not exactly as the link but to match the provided Figma layout while keeping consistency with the app’s existing design language where appropriate.

**Requirements:**

* Use the Figma file as the primary reference for structure, spacing, and components, but adapt elements slightly if needed to maintain overall app design consistency.
* Update theme files for global styling consistency.
* Preserve all backend and business logic; map existing functionality to new UI elements.
* Integrate new widgets with placeholder callbacks (`onTap: () {}`) for features not yet implemented.
* Rebuild the screen’s UI from scratch for clean, maintainable code, while integrating with the existing logic.
* Adjust Supabase schemas only if required for supporting the redesign.
* Pixel-perfect replication where possible, with minimal allowed tweaks for brand/design cohesion.
* You have full control to refactor, rename, and reorganize code for clarity and maintainability.

**Notes:**

* Focus entirely on design implementation; testing is not required at this stage.
* Version control is in place; all changes will be tracked.

**Manual Inputs:**

* **Screen Name/File:** Page Name
* **Figma Link:** Page Link
