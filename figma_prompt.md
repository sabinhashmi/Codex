Redesign Flutter App to Match Figma Layout

Rebuild the existing Flutter app to precisely match the structure, layout, and styling defined in the Figma design, while preserving all current functionality aligned with the new UI.

Requirements:
- Use Figma as the single source of truth for layout, spacing, and UI components; update theme files for global consistency.
- Preserve all backend/business logic; map current view/tile logic to new Figma components.
- Integrate new widgets and elements with stub callbacks (onTap: () {}) for future features.
- Rebuild screens from scratch for clean, maintainable UI structure integrating smoothly with existing logic.
- Modify Supabase schemas if needed to support UI redesign.
- Focus solely on design replication and workflow alignment; no testing needed at this stage.

Notes:
- Pixel-perfect recreation of Figma design is the goal.
- Full control over codebase: refactor, rename, reorganize as needed.
- Project is version-controlled; changes are trackable and reversible.
